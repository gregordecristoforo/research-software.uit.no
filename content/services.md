# Services

We provide multiple services to researchers at UiT ranging from short consultations to collaborations lasting multiple years. If you are interested in collaborating with us, please reach out to us via email or come to one of our office hours. 

## Financing model

All research software engineers at UiT are employed in the IT department. This means that we can provide our services without the need of making a profit. The exact financing model looks as follows:

### Office hours and single meetings

If you only need help with a small project, we invite you to our office hours or reach out to us in order to schedule a meeting. Both office hours and single meetings are free of charge for UiT researchers. If you are unsure whether you want to collaborate with us, both office hours or a single meeting can be ideal to discuss potential collaborations. 

### Including RSE in grant proposals

For long term collaborations, we recommend including the Research Software Engineering group in your grant proposal. This way you can include a chosen time fraction of one or multiple Research Software Engineers in your project, ranging from one day a week to a full position. The time of one RSE is billed roughly equal to **fill in position code**. The RSE is expected to work with an effort of roughly 85% of their time on the project, with the remaining 15% being used for administrative tasks, office hours and professional development.

### Hourly based rate

If you already have available funds or you need help with a project that is not suitable for a grant proposal, we can also provide our services on an hourly basis. As of August 2025 our hourly rate is 570 NOK.

(Comment for PR reviewer: This rate is calculated as follows: Start with an hourly salary of 400 NOK, normalize it by factor 0.85 as described above, add 25% overhead: 400 NOK / 0.85 + 400 NOK * 0.25 = 570.59 NOK.)
