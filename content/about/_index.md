# About us

Together, we have many years of experience programming for science, mentoring,
and teaching computing.

**[Radovan Bast](https://bast.fr)** is a research software engineer with
background in theoretical chemistry. He leads the
[CodeRefinery](https://coderefinery.org) project.  At UiT he leads the
high-performance computing group and the research software engineering group.
These days mostly programming in Python, Rust, R, and JavaScript but has spent
many years with Fortran, C(++), and CMake.

**Magnar Bjørgve** has a background in applied mathematics and theoretical chemistry.
He is working in the GPU and training team at [NRIS](https://documentation.sigma2.no/)
at the University of Tromsø, Norway.

**Gregor Decristoforo** gained experience in parallel programming and research
software engineering during his PhD in computational physics. As a Postdoc at
UiT he set up and maintained the [Complex Systems
Modelling](https://github.com/uit-cosmo) Github organization. Gregor has
experience in Python, C++ and CUDA and is currently learning R and Rust.

**Jørn Dietze** is almost finished with a Ph.D in bioinformatics.
He is working with high-performance computing systems and
has experience with programming in Python, Julia, and a little bit of C.
He is part of [NRIS](https://documentation.sigma2.no/)
at the University of Tromsø, Norway, and the
[LUMI User Support Team](https://www.lumi-supercomputer.eu/).

**Gabriel Gerez** is almost finished with his PhD in Theoretical chemistry. 
He is currently part of the Software team providing support with installation 
and use of scientific software in the clusters. He is part of the 
Research software engineering (RSE) group at UiT where he helps researchers with
issues such as code design and scalability of software to HPC. Gabriel is experienced 
in developing code in C++ and Python.

## Former group members

**Bente Barge** is a Ph.D student in computational chemistry and part-time
member of the HPC group at the University of Tromsø, Norway. Coding has been an
important part of her Ph.D and her interest in research software development
has evolved during her time in academia.

**Geir Villy Isaksen** was in our group when we started this when we were only
two persons. We are grateful for his contributions to the group, the artwork,
work on the website, and outreach.
