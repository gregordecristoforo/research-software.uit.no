# Testimonials

- "The Research Software Engineering Group has been of great help to me in
  starting to use Git and organizing my code. I joined the Code Refinery
  workshops, which provided a good introduction to Git. In the time that
  followed, the RSE group was available to answer Git-related questions,
  making it easier for me to apply Git to my own research work. The RSE group
  also introduced me to tools like Black, Flake8, and docstring guides for
  cleaning up code, as well as creating top-level functions in scripts and
  importing functions via symlink. The sessions have been a combination of
  in-person help and group discussions, both of which have worked out well.
  The group is always welcoming and eager to help with any problems you may
  have."

- "I had approached the RSE group seeking help to improve the efficiency and
  performance of my python code which was taking approximately 4 weeks to run
  even when using 8 cores of a server.

  The objective was to go through 8 years of data stored in approximately
  18000 txt files and extract certain parameters based on a set of given
  conditions. Even though I had used python before, I got the opportunity to
  learn about new functionalities and features of pandas dataframes.  Using
  Black and other extensions, I was taught to organize my code more
  efficiently thereby improving its readability. Additionally, Radovan also
  showed me that is possible to import my own functions as separate modules
  without the need to populate my script with a lot of functions. These were
  so powerful that the execution time for the script slid down **from 4 weeks
  to below an hour** which was really cool!

  Radovan also motivated me to use GitHub, which I had never used before, by
  introducing features that could be utilized by a research student like me
  who uses a lot of data and scripts. I am starting to explore more features
  of GitHub and python on my own now. I am really happy with the guidance I
  had received from the RSE group especially that from Radovan who helped me
  re-think the way I program. I felt that the RSE group members are so
  welcoming and excited to help learn and relearn new things together."

- "As an environmental chemist, I’ve spent years working with a large research
  code written in Visual Basic 6 (VB6). My programming skills have been limited
  to trial and error in VB6. When we finally decided to translate our code from
  VB6 to Python for long-term sustainability, I came across RSE by coincidence.
  At that point, I had no idea where to start learning Python or how to approach
  the code effectively. I was uncertain about how much assistance RSE could
  provide for this daunting task.

  However, my experience with RSE turned out to be incredibly positive. From the
  outset, they were approachable, friendly, and helpful. They patiently guided me
  through Python basics and introduced me to essential tools like docstring
  guidelines, testing, pylint, black, profiling and git. While I did most of the
  programming myself, they provided strategic advice on code architecture and
  structure, covering both simple concepts and more intricate ones. Most
  importantly, they introduced me to a programming mindset—how to think when
  designing code, what to prioritize, and the importance of principles like DRY
  code, code smells, and classes screaming to get out.

  From dealing with a massive spaghetti codebase in VB6 – once so convoluted that
  I had to print it out on paper to trace loops and connections, I now have a
  more robust, flexible, sustainable and modern codebase in an object-oriented
  design.

  Collaborating with RSE opened up a whole new world for me. I learned things I
  wish I’d known a decade ago. Not only did they assist with the challenging task
  of porting my code from VB6 to Python, but they also helped me become a better,
  more independent programmer. It felt like having a personal programming
  coach—one who not only knows the technical aspects but can also communicate
  effectively with non-programmers. Their patience in addressing my questions and
  mistakes was invaluable. I doubt I would have found anyone else who could have
  helped me with the same enthusiasm and dedication as RSE.

  The collaboration with the RSE team transformed the porting process into an
  enjoyable, fun and rewarding experience. I can’t praise them enough, especially
  Jørn, whom I met with regularly for almost a year. I’m forever grateful for
  everything he taught (and continues to teach) me. I sincerely hope our
  collaboration continues, and if you’re considering reaching out to them, don’t
  hesitate—just do it. And bring cookies!"

- I've been working with and am still working with open sourcing of a Fortran
  source code which would be near impossible without the software engineering
  support group.

- I have been using the online cluster to run my OpenFOAM simulations for my
  PhD research, and I couldn't be happier with the support provided.
  The support team is knowledgeable and responsive, always ready to help me
  navigate through any challenges I face.  I highly recommend this service to
  any researcher looking for reliable and efficient computational resources.

- Great support. Saved me weeks and weeks of time. Super
  helpful and friendly.

- RSE helped me adapt my analysis to run on the HPC computing cluster at UiT.
  This cut the time to run my analysis from many days down to hours.

- I got help from the RSE Group structuring my code, which has been very
  helpful for the specific project, but also for future projects.

- The RSE group members are really smart and innovative when it comes to coding
  and they’re able to communicate these solutions and the reasoning behind them
  in a way that makes sense for me so that I can apply it in my future coding
  activities.

- The RSE team made an incredible effort to both understand my problem, and
  explain possible solutions to it in a way that I (as a relatively
  non-technical person) could understand. When I contacted RSE, I was trying to
  estimate a model with Bayesian estimation techniques on highly skewed data.
  The code took forever to run, and locked up my computer. I couldn't work on
  anything else for several hours (sometimes days) when I ran the code. The
  analysis was exploratory, meaning that I had to run several versions of the
  model to find the right one. With the help from RSE, I found a way to speed
  up the code to just a few minutes. This enabled me to trouble shoot the model
  and move forward in my analysis. Without them, I would not have been able to
  finish the analysis! Thanks a million!

- The support offered by the research and software engineering team at UiT is
  immensely useful to anyone who wants to integrate coding into their research.
  Direct access to knowledgeable people allows for quick and personal
  assistance that helped me turn an idea into reality.  In my case, the support
  was focused on optimizing code and as a result I was able to generate results
  within minutes instead of hours.
