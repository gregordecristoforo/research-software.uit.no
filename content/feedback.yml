      The Research Software Engineering Group has been of great help to me in
      starting to use Git and organizing my code.

      The execution time for my script went down from 4 weeks to below an hour which
      was really cool!

      Like having a personal programming coach—one who not only knows the
      technical aspects but can also communicate effectively with non-programmers.

      If you’re considering reaching out to them, don’t hesitate — just do it. And
      bring cookies!

      [...] open sourcing of a Fortran
      source code which would be near impossible without the software engineering
      support group.

      I got help from the RSE Group structuring my code, which has been very
      helpful for the specific project, but also for future projects.

     They're able to communicate these solutions and the reasoning behind them
     in a way that makes sense for me so that I can apply it in my future coding
     activities.

     The RSE team made an incredible effort to both understand my problem, and
     explain possible solutions to it in a way that I (as a relatively
     non-technical person) could understand.

     The support offered by the research and software engineering team at UiT is
     immensely useful to anyone who wants to integrate coding into their research.
